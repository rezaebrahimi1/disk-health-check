# disk-health-check
I use this shell script to investigate helath check of disks which are attached to LSI megaraid controller.

You need to create a directory for each disk and put pdinfo, smart and badblock tests results of disks. 
I dont push the file related to generating smart, pdinfo and badblock files to maintain confidentiality.
